    "# Profitable Long Term Investments: An Analysis of American Housing Prices\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As real estate can be a finicky industry, it is hugely important to understand where to buy a property and what property type will be the most profitable. In this analysis we will be analyzing property types in cities to determine which property type and location makes the most sense for a long term investment. The property type and location must meet our following requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we want to buy a property in a location that is steadily increasing in price, allowing a profit to be made when it is eventually sold. Second, we want to determine which housing types are mispriced within the location chosen from the first requirment. The greater the misprice, the greater the deal may be when compared to the national average. Lastly, due to budgetary reasons we want to buy in a relatively cheap city when compared to the national average.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we will be using comes from the [Zillow Home Value Index](https://data.world/realestate/zillow-zip-zhvi). To follow along with this anlysis and run every cell correctly, you will need to download each document and place them in the same folder as this Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon completion of the analysis, we have found that a Single Family property in Hermosa Beach, California is the best property to invest in given our requirements stated above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please refer to the full analysis below for a more in-depth exploration of housing prices and trends throughout America.\n"

    "Lastly, it can be seen that the 3 bedroom property type is the best deal right now. The average price for a 3 bedroom property is roughly 275,000.00 across America. This means that you get more bang for your buck compared to the other houses. For example if you were to buy a 4 bedrooms house you would have to pay roughly 375,000.00 and for a 2 bedroom you would have to pay roughly 210,000.00. for only a 60,000.00 increase you can have 3 bedrooms. However, this does not take into account square footage, as we continue this analysis we may find that the better deal is not the 3 bedroom property"
