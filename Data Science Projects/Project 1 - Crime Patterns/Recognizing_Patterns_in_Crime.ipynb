    "As Police departments are a publicly funded entity, we have access to a great deal of crime data. In analyzing this crime data from the Montgomery County police department, we would like to explore two main topics. First we would like to find as many patterns in the crime as possible and second, determine the safety levels of cities throughout the county.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis we will be looking at crime in [Montgomery County, Maryland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_County,_Maryland). The data we will be working with can be found [here](https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Public-Safety/Crime/icn6-v9z3).\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon completion of this analysis, we are able to determine the following major results:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The morning period between 6AM to 12PM had the most overall crime being reported\n",
    "- Approximately 35% of all crime reported would be considered violent\n",
    "- Brookeville has the largest amount of crime being reported for not only violent and non-violent crimes, but also just violent crimes\n",
    "- The Morning period between 6AM to 12PM has the most violent crime being reported\n",
    "\n",
    "Please read through this document in detail as the analysis provides a very thorough review of the dataset and breaks each of the tasks mentioned above into many different components. "

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the dataset from Montgomery County we were able to analyze and determine several key points: \n",
    "\n",
    "- October was the month that had the most crime being recorded. However, because the dataset only has info from July to October we cannot conclusively determine that this is the largest month throughout the year. Therefore, further yearly trends cannot be determined from this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Over a 24 hour period, we determined that the day is when most crimes are being reported. Furthermore, we wanted more resolution on this time frame and split out the 24 hour period into four six-hour intervals. Using this data, it was determined that the morning was the largest with the afternoon a close second 29.8% and 29.3%, respectively. Both of these values were roughly double the amount of the night time value. The reason the night time value may be so much lower is that there are less police officers patrolling the area and able to be dispatched.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The day of the week that had the most crime being reported was Tuesday. The weekend, Saturday and Sunday, had the least amount of crime being reported. This again could fit our theory that there are less police officers available to be dispatched and so those days are going have less crime reported.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The median dispatch time for officers was 48 seconds. However, because we were not able to compare our results using any other data found through online research, we cannot conclusively say whether this a is good or bad result. As this is not the actual response time for a crime it may not be as important, but should still be considered an important aspect of responding to a crime.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Brookeville was found to have the largest per capita amount of crimes being recorded with approximately of 2 crimes reported per 1000 people (per capita). This is interesting because this town only contains a population of 134 people. The largest amount of crime reported by a city was Silver Spring with roughly 35% of all crime occurring there but only had a per capita value of approximately 0.5, which was the fourth largest.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The amount of violent crime that were committed in Montgomery county was 35%, while the non-violent crime was 65%. In order to determine which crimes were violent and which were not, a unique list of each crime description was printed out. Each unique value was then looked through to confirm whether or not it was violent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The number of violent crimes per capita was found again to be Brookeville with a per capita value of roughly 1.2 per capita. Silver Spring was again determined to have the largest amount of violent crime reported. This should be no surprise as the location with the most crime should also have the most violent crime occurring there as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For violent crimes, we again determined that the day is when most violent crimes were reported. Furthermore, breaking this into a 6-hour interval we found that the morning and afternoon  had the largest amount of violent crime being reported with 36.8% and 34.9%, respectively. In these time intervals, we can note an increase in both morning and afternoon by 7% and 6%, respectively, when compared to our previous analysis of total crimes being reported.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Without more information on a country wide crime rate, it may be hard to conclusively determine which cities or towns should be avoided, after looking at all the information. Using [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_crime_rate) we can actually determine a Violent Crime Rate per Capita value for Baltimore, the capital of Maryland, and use this as a benchmark to compare our values.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this calculation, we have found that Baltimore, Maryland has a violent crime rate of 2.47 per Capita. This means that Brookville is still twice as safe as Baltimore. Also, we can say that any town within Montgomery County is safer than the Capital of the state itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you should always use caution when visiting these cities in Montgomery County, especially between the Morning and Afternoon time intervals as that seems to be when the majority of crime is reported."
