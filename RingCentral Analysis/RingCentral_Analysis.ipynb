    "# Phone Time per Month Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis I will be sifting through large amounts of data to determine an average value a bookkeeper within the company is on the phone for. There are two differences we will want to look at here:\n",
    "\n",
    "Incoming Calls - Which are calls that the client calls the bookkeeper at any given time (should be much lower than outgoing)\n",
    "\n",
    "Outgoing Calls - Which are calls that the bookkeeper makes to the client (or someone else)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these two values we can come up with an average representation of how long a bookkeeper is on the phone for:\n",
    "\n",
    "Total time on phone per month = Avg Incoming call time + Avg Outgoing call time\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE* It is important that limitations are realized. \n",
    "\n",
    "1) This analysis does not account for the difference due to tax time phone calls\n",
    "2) Ring Central has been known not to accurately track calls which may affect more than one bookkeeper\n",
    "3) Within the RingCentral data as an extension is recycled, there is a chance that the data may not have been ported over correctly. Our calculation can only be as accurate as the data we use. This is likely a small error and wouldn't affect the bookkeepers as much as it would someone that is on the phone for longer extents."
